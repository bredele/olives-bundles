==============

This is a showcase of what Olives.js is capable of. First you will need to install Olives.js.

### Install Olives.js

Olives requires an AMD/commonJS compatible loader. I use requirejs: http://requirejs.org/.

```html
	<script src="./require.js"></script>
	<script src="./Emily.js"></script>
	<script src="./Olives.js"></script>
```	

Olives.js is based on Emily.js. Both are located on this directory : https://github.com/flams.
